# Model annotations
 
A model can carry annotations as specially-formatted comments. The general
format for such annotations is as follows:

```
# <tag>: <value>
```

The annotation must be a comment in the target language and it must occupy the whole line. If the annotation tag is recognized, the value becomes associated with the tag. A tag contains a series of tag elements separated by dots. The first tag element is either 'fastscore' or 'ModelOp'.

Certain annotations are slot-specific. They are relevant for a particular stream slot or a group of slots. The slot scope is always the last element of the tag of a slot-specific annotation. The following slot scopes are supported:

Slot scope	| Applicable to	| Example
------------|---------------|--------
&lt;slot-number> | The slot <slot-number> | # fastscore.schema.3: schema-1
&lt;slot-name>	| The named slot | #fastscore.schema.err: schema-1
$all | All stream slots | #fastscore.schema.$all: schema-1
$in | All input slots (0, 2, 4,...) | #fastscore.recordsets.$in: yes
$out | All output slots (1, 3, 5,...) | #fastscore.recordsets.$out: false

The slot scope can be omitted. If omitted, the default slot scope is assumed. The default scope depends on the annotation tag.

The current list of supported model annotations is given in the table below.

Tag	| Slot-specific | Description | Allowed values | Example
----|---------------|-------------|----------------|--------
fastscore.schema.&lt;slot> | Yes (default scope: $all) | The name of the Avro schema | | # fastscore.schema.0: schema-1
fastscore.recordsets.&lt;slot> | Yes (default scope: $all) | The 'recordsets' flag | true / false / yes / no | # fastscore.recordsets.$in: yes
fastscore.action.&lt;slot> | Yes (default score: $in) | The name of the action function (defaults to 'action') | <func-name> / none | # fastscore.action: score_report
fastscore.slot.&lt;slot> | Yes (default score: $all) | Set to 'unused' to disable the slot. | in-use / unused | #fastscore.slot.1: unused
fastscore.module-attached | No | The name of the code module included as a model attachment | | #fastscore.module-attached: mylib
fastscore.snapshots | No | Set to 'eof' to automatically take a model snapshot when the run completes. | none / eof | #fastscore.snapshots: eof

A `fastscore.slot.<num-or-name>: in-use` annotation marks the slot as being used by the model. If a slot number or name is mentioned in the
schema/recordsets/action annotation it implicitly marks the slot as being in
use. Note that in-use annotation can not refer to $all/$in/$out scopes.  On the
other hand, the `fastscore.slot.<slot-scope>: unused`  annotation cancels the
effect of any previous annotations that mentioned the &lt;slot-scope>. For
example, `fastscore.slot.$output: unused` indicate that the model does not
produce any outputs. The 'unused' annotation can remove the default slots (0
and 1) from consideration.

Setting `fastscore.action` to `none` disables the action callbacks. The model
becomes purely explicit. Explicit models read from stream slots directly and may
exit before all streams reach EOF.

The annotations in the table below are deprecated and should not be used for
new models. However, they are recognized by the Engine.

Deprecated annotation | Equivalent annotation(s)
----------------------|-------------------------
fastscore.input: &lt;schema> |fastscore.schema.0: &lt;schema>
fastscore.output: &lt;schema> |fastscore.schema.1: &lt;schema>
fastscore.recordsets: none/input/output/both |fastscore.recordsets.0: &lt;yes/no> /fastscore.recordsets.1: &lt;yes/no>

## PFA models

PFA models currently do not support multiple input/output stream slots. Thus
their annotations do not use a slot scope. Annotations of a PFA model are
represented as subelements of a 'metadata' element. The supported annotations
are given in the table below.

Annotation | Description | Default
-----------|-------------|--------
"recordsets": "none" / "recordsets": "input" / "recordsets": "output" / "recordsets": "both" | The 'recordsets' flag | "none"
"snapshots": "none" / "snapshots": "eof" | Set to 'eof' to automatically take a model snapshot when the run completes. | "none"

Note that for a PFA model keeps its schemas in two (mandatory) top-level elements: 'input' and 'output'. An example of an annotated PFA model:

```
{
  "input": "int",
  "output": "int",
  "metadata": {
    "recordsets": "none",
    "snapshots": "eof"
  },
  "action": ...
}
```
