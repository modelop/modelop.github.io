# ModelOp Center Compare

As a general microservice tool, Compare allows users to quickly generate customized or standard methods for comparing performance between two, or many, models.

Compare is a microservice that will generate statistics between two streams of data; one is a truth stream and a second stream under test. Generated statistics allow the user to understand the accuracy and performance of models, and Compare can be used in production or during development and test to compare candidate models.
